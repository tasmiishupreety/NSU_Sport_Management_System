The Indoor Sports Management System is a project developed as part of a course at North South University. The system is designed to facilitate the management of indoor sports facilities, allowing both users and administrators to interact with the platform.

Key features of the system include:

1. User Management: Users can register, log in, and book indoor sports facilities.

2. Admin Panel: Admins can manage user roles, view bookings, and oversee operations.

3. Database Integration: The system uses a database to store user details, booking information, and other related data.

4. Web Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface built with PHP, where users can easily navigate and book facilities.

This project combines web development, database management, and user authentication to streamline the booking and management of sports facilities.
